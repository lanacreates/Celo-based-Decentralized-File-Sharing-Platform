# Celo-based Decentralized File Sharing Platform

This repository contains the code for a decentralized file sharing platform built on the Celo blockchain. The project was developed as part of a tutorial and serves as a comprehensive guide for developers interested in creating decentralized applications using Celo and IPFS.

## About

The platform allows users to securely store and share files in a decentralized manner. The application is built using Solidity for smart contracts, IPFS for decentralized storage, and React for the frontend user interface. Some key features of the application include:

- **File Upload and Retrieval**: Users can upload and retrieve files from the IPFS network using Celo addresses.
- **File Sharing**: Users can share files with others by sharing the unique file identifier generated upon upload.
- **File Permissions**: The file owner can control who can view or download their files.
- **Enhanced File Viewer**: The application supports the preview of various file types, including PDFs and videos.
- **Improved User Experience**: The application includes features like user profiles, file search, and the ability to comment on or like files.

## Prerequisites

Before starting with this repository, it is advised to complete the tutorial on [Implementing Celo-based Decentralized Storage](https://celo.academy/t/implementing-celo-based-decentralized-storage/320). It provides the groundwork that this application builds upon.

You will also need:

- A basic understanding of React, JavaScript, and Solidity.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your local machine.
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or another Celo wallet set up.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lanacreates/Celo-Decentralized-File-Sharing-Platform.git
cd Celo-Decentralized-File-Sharing-Platform
npm install
```

You can then start the local development server:

```bash
npm start
```
